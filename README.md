## Important Notes

1. **API Key Permissions**: Your Binance API key needs futures trading permissions.
2. **Risk Warning**: Trading cryptocurrencies involves significant risk. Use this bot at your own risk.
3. **Testing**: Always test with small amounts before using larger position sizes.
4. **MACD Configuration**: The bot uses MACD with parameters 5/13/1 (fast EMA period: 5, slow EMA period: 13, signal period: 1) which is more responsive than the traditional 12/26/9 settings. This helps catch trends earlier but may generate more false signals in choppy markets.
5. **Indicator Combination**: The bot uses a combination of multiple indicators (RSI, candle patterns, EMA crossover, Bollinger Bands, MACD, and Smart Money Concept) to generate stronger signals and reduce false positives.
6. **Smart Money Concept (SMC)**: The bot analyzes market structure to identify trends, reversals, and key price levels using SMC principles. This includes Break of Structure (BOS) detection and Fair Value Gap (FVG) identification.

## Testing

The bot includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure all components work correctly. To run the tests:

```
python run_tests.py
```

The test suite includes:

- **BinanceClient Tests**: Tests API interactions and data handling
- **Indicators Tests**: Tests technical indicators calculations (RSI, EMA, Bollinger Bands, MACD, SMC)
- **PositionManager Tests**: Tests position sizing, account management, and risk controls
- **TelegramNotifier Tests**: Tests notification functionality
- **TradingBot Tests**: Tests the main bot logic and signal processing

Always run the tests after making changes to ensure everything works as expected.

## Logs

The bot logs all activities to both the console and a `bot.log` file.

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues

If you experience connection issues with the Binance API, try the following solutions:

1. **Check your internet connection**: Make sure you have a stable internet connection.

2. **Use a proxy**: If you're behind a firewall or in a region with restricted access, you can use a proxy:
   ```
   USE_PROXY=TRUE
   PROXY_URL=http://your-proxy-server:port
   ```

3. **Try fallback endpoints**: The bot automatically tries multiple Binance API endpoints if the primary one fails.

4. **Increase timeouts**: If you have a slow connection, you might need to increase the connection timeouts in the code.

5. **Check Binance API status**: Verify that the Binance API is operational by visiting their status page.

6. **VPN issues**: If you're using a VPN, try connecting without it or switch to a different server.

### Other Common Issues

1. **API key permissions**: Make sure your Binance API key has the correct permissions (Futures trading enabled).

2. **Insufficient balance**: Ensure you have enough balance in your Futures account.

3. **Symbol not found**: Verify that the trading symbol exists and is available for Futures trading.

4. **Rate limiting**: If you're making too many requests, you might get rate-limited. The bot implements exponential backoff to handle this.
