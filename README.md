## Important Notes

1. **API Key Permissions**: Your Binance API key needs futures trading permissions.
2. **Risk Warning**: Trading cryptocurrencies involves significant risk. Use this bot at your own risk.
3. **Testing**: Always test with small amounts before using larger position sizes.
4. **MACD Configuration**: The bot uses MACD with parameters 5/13/1 (fast EMA period: 5, slow EMA period: 13, signal period: 1) which is more responsive than the traditional 12/26/9 settings. This helps catch trends earlier but may generate more false signals in choppy markets.
5. **Indicator Combination**: The bot uses a combination of 5 different indicators (RSI, candle patterns, EMA crossover, Bollinger Bands, and MACD) to generate stronger signals and reduce false positives.

## Testing

The bot includes a comprehensive test suite to ensure all components work correctly. To run the tests:

```
python run_tests.py
```

The test suite includes:

- **BinanceClient Tests**: Tests API interactions and data handling
- **Indicators Tests**: Tests technical indicators calculations (RSI, EMA, Bollinger Bands, MACD)
- **PositionManager Tests**: Tests position sizing, account management, and risk controls
- **TelegramNotifier Tests**: Tests notification functionality
- **TradingBot Tests**: Tests the main bot logic and signal processing

Always run the tests after making changes to ensure everything works as expected.

## Logs

The bot logs all activities to both the console and a `bot.log` file.
